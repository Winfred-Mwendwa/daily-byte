# Big-O

## Time

When you see a problem where the number of elements in the problem space gets halved each time, that will likely be a 0( log N) runtime.

## Space

In a recursive implementation of binary search, the space complexity is O (logN). This means that the algorithm uses a logarithmic amount of space, proportional to the size of the input array. The reason is that each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack, and the number of recursive calls is at most logN (the height of the binary search tree).
