# What

 A string (data type) is a sequence of characters and can contain letters, numbers, symbols and even spaces. It must be enclosed in quotation marks for it to be recognized as a string.

## PY

- enclosed in single, double or tripple quotes(multiline strings)

- immutable

- string interpolation in Python: <https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/string-interpolation>

```py
name = 'World'
program = 'Python'
print(f'Hello {name}! This is {program}')

a = 5
b = 2
print(f'{a} multiplied by {b} is {a * b}')
```

- string indexing starts at 0 for the first character and -1 for the last character
