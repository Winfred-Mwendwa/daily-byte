# Time Complexity

- Finding the shortest string takes O(n) time, where n is the number of strings in the input list.
- The loop iterates through the characters of the shortest string and, for each character, compares it with the corresponding character in all the strings in the list. In the worst case, this loop runs for the length of the shortest string, which is O(m), where m is the length of the shortest string.
- Since the loop is nested within the previous loop that iterates through the input list, the overall time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of strings, and m is the length of the shortest string.

## Space Complexity

- The space complexity is primarily determined by the variables used in the function:
shortest_str stores the shortest string, which takes O(m) space, where m is the length of the shortest string.
- i and char are loop variables, which take constant space.
- Therefore, the space complexity is O(m), where m is the length of the shortest string.
