You can determine whether a robot vacuum will return to its original position by counting the number of left (L) and right (R) moves as well as up (U) and down (D) moves. If the count of L and R moves is equal, and the count of U and D moves is equal, then the robot vacuum will return to its original position. Otherwise, it won't.
