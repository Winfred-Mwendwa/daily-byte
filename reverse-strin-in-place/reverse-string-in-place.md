# Space and time complexity

The time complexity of the reverse string method is O(n), where "n" is the length of the input string s. This is because in the worst case, you need to swap every character in the string to reverse it.

The space complexity of the reverse string method is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of additional memory regardless of the input string's length. The space used by the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input string; it only uses a few extra variables (e.g., left and right) and the input string s`. This makes it an in-place reversal algorithm with minimal memory usage.
